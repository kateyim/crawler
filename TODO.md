* change the online algorithm to the upper bound algorithm
* how to log the crawling results
* pause and resume downloads crawling

* analysis the results, draw the points on the map.
- record the crawling times of each point!


* implement the heuristic algorithm, how much it exceed the upper bound algorithm?
