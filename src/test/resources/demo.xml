Staff are super friendly and funny. I like the decoration and the fact that they have a full bar. But the best thing about this place is their pizza. There are many choices and I tried few already. They always exceeded my expectation. I will go back for sure.</LastReviewIntro></Rating><Distance>1.11</Distance><Url>http://local.yahoo.com/info-21300761-oregano-s-woodfired-pizza-los-altos</Url><ClickUrl>http://local.yahoo.com/info-21300761-oregano-s-woodfired-pizza-los-altos</ClickUrl><MapUrl>http://local.yahoo.com/info-21300761-oregano-s-woodfired-pizza-los-altos?viewtype=map</MapUrl><BusinessUrl></BusinessUrl><BusinessClickUrl></BusinessClickUrl><Categories><Category id="96926236">Restaurants</Category><Category id="96926234">Carry Out &amp; Take Out</Category><Category id="96926243">Pizza</Category><Category id="96926237">American Restaurants</Category></Categories></Result><Result id="21398996"><Title>Pizz'a Chicago</Title><Address>4115 El Camino Real</Address><City>Palo Alto</City><State>CA</State><Phone>(650) 424-9400</Phone><Latitude>37.414319</Latitude><Longitude>-122.126205</Longitude><Rating><AverageRating>4</AverageRating><TotalRatings>8</TotalRatings><TotalReviews>8</TotalReviews><LastReviewDate>1269603231</LastReviewDate><LastReviewIntro>My family and I were going to Ikea and we were craving pizza. This place got great reviews so we tried it out. This place sucks. Customer service was eh. A lot of workers were standing around. Just kind of chatting. We ordered our pizza and waited. I noticed that they were serving people who came in after us. So I talked to our waiter and he said ours was coming up. I think they forgot about us or gave our pizza to someone else. Either way it took them over 1 hour to get us our medium pizza and it wasnt even cooked all the way. Crust was nasty. The pizza was nasty. Management nor anybody else tried to make it right. They just looked at us funny. That killed our appettite. So we paid for their over priced pizza and left.</LastReviewIntro></Rating><Distance>0.25</Distance><Url>http://local.yahoo.com/info-21398996-pizz-a-chicago-palo-alto</Url><ClickUrl>http://local.yahoo.com/info-21398996-pizz-a-chicago-palo-alto</ClickUrl><MapUrl>http://local.yahoo.com/info-21398996-pizz-a-chicago-palo-alto?viewtype=map</MapUrl><BusinessUrl>http://www.pizzachicago.com/</BusinessUrl><BusinessClickUrl>http://www.pizzachicago.com/</BusinessClickUrl><Categories><Category id="96926225">Salad Restaurants</Category><Category id="96926236">Restaurants</Category><Category id="96926234">Carry Out &amp; Take Out</Category><Category id="96926243">Pizza</Category><Category id="96926190">Italian Restaurants</Category></Categories></Result></ResultSet>
